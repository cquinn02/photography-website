# About Cindy Quinn

## Phoenix's Premier Headshot Photographer

Hi, I'm **Cindy Quinn**, the owner and photographer behind CMQ Headshots. For over 12 years, I've been passionate about helping professionals feel confident and look their absolute best in front of the camera.

### My Journey to Photography

Originally born and raised in Canada as a Canadian army brat, I later moved to Beavercreek, Ohio, before finding my home in Phoenix, Arizona. My diverse background has given me the ability to connect with people from all walks of life, making them feel comfortable during what can often be an intimidating experience.

I took my first headshot in October 2012, and I knew immediately that this was my calling. There's something magical about capturing that perfect moment when someone's personality shines through – when they look confident, approachable, and authentically themselves.

### My Photography Philosophy

**"Comfortable, Easy Headshots You're Going to Love"** isn't just my tagline – it's my promise to every client who walks through my door.

I believe that the best headshots happen when people feel relaxed and natural. That's why I've built my entire approach around creating a comfortable environment where you can be yourself. My clients consistently tell me how at ease I made them feel, even those who are typically camera-shy.

### Professional Expertise

As both owner and photographer of CMQ Headshots, I specialize in:

- **Business & Executive Headshots** - Helping professionals present their best selves
- **Actor Headshots** - Industry-standard portraits with guidance on different looks for casting
- **Corporate Photography** - On-location team photography for businesses
- **LinkedIn Photography** - Optimized headshots for professional networking

### My Commitment to Excellence

Every session continues until you have the images you need – whether that takes 20 minutes or 3 hours. I'm not watching the clock; I'm focused on capturing headshots that will boost your career and business marketing efforts.

### Serving Our Community

I'm proud to serve the Greater Phoenix area, including Scottsdale, Tempe, and Chandler. As a way to give back to those who serve our community, I offer a 20% discount to military personnel and active first responders.

### Education & Experience

I hold an Associate's degree and am described as a strong arts and design professional. But more importantly, I bring 12 years of hands-on experience making people look and feel their best.

**Ready to work together?** I'd love to help you create headshots that truly represent who you are and where you're going in your career.
